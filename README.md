# CampaignAILab

CampaignAILab is an experimental Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord mod used for
instrumenting and logging AI decisions and their outcomes during gameplay.

This project is **not** intended for regular players.
It exists purely as a research and data collection tool to study campaign-level AI behavior.

The mod focuses on:
- observing AI decision-making
- recording contextual state
- logging downstream outcomes over time

There are no gameplay features, balance changes, or user-facing mechanics.

The codebase is expected to change frequently and may break between game versions.

Use at your own risk.
This repository is provided as-is with no guarantees of stability or support.
